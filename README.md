This is a research project to develop a parallel runtime for energy efficient SIMD computation. The idea is to measure energy usage for different
benchmarks with different SIMD instructions in order to get optimal ISA with efficient energy usage for the target application. I am working on this
project as an undergraduate student researcher in High Performance Computing(HiPeC) Lab, IIIT Delhi under the guidance of Dr. Vivek Kumar.
